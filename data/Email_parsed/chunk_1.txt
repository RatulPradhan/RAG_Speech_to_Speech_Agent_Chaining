Hi Mr Connor,

I am writing to follow up and inquire if there were any developments with the fellowship application.
I wanted to reiterate my excitement as I am very enthusiastic about the opportunity and would greatly
appreciate any chance to interview if deemed fit!

Thank you for your time and consideration.
